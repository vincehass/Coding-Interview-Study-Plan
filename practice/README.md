## üéØ How to Use

### Step 1: Study the Main Content First

- Complete the daily lessons in the main week folders (week1/, week2/, etc.)
- Understand the theory and review the comprehensive examples
- Don't jump to practice problems without understanding the concepts

### Step 2: Work Through Practice Problems

- Open the appropriate `practice_problems.py` file for your week
- Read each problem statement carefully including:
  - **DESCRIPTION**: What the problem is asking
  - **CONSTRAINTS**: Input limitations and requirements
  - **EXAMPLES**: Sample inputs and expected outputs
  - **EXPECTED COMPLEXITY**: Time and space requirements
- Write your solution in the designated space

### Step 3: Test Your Solutions

- Each file contains a comprehensive test function
- Uncomment the test function call at the bottom
- Run the file to check your solutions against expected outputs
- Debug and iterate until all tests pass

### Step 4: Compare with References

- Reference solutions are provided at the bottom of each file
- Only look at these after attempting the problems yourself
- Use them to understand different approaches and optimizations

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### Problem-Solving Approach

1. **Read Carefully**: Understand the problem completely before coding
2. **Plan First**: Think about approach and edge cases
3. **Start Simple**: Implement basic solution first
4. **Optimize**: Improve time/space complexity if needed
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify with provided test cases

### Code Quality

- Write clean, readable code with meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Handle edge cases (empty inputs, single elements, etc.)
- Follow the expected time/space complexity requirements

### Learning Strategy

- Don't rush through problems
- If stuck, think about similar problems from the main lessons
- Try multiple approaches when possible
- Understand the "why" behind each solution

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Time Management**: Spend 30-45 minutes per problem initially
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Notice similar patterns across problems
3. **Mock Interview Practice**: Explain your solution out loud
4. **Code Without IDE**: Practice writing code on paper/whiteboard
5. **Follow-up Questions**: Think about optimizations and variations

## üöÄ Meta Interview Focus

These practice problems are specifically chosen to align with Meta's interview patterns:

- **Problem Types**: Core algorithms that appear frequently
- **Complexity Requirements**: Focus on optimal solutions
- **Code Quality**: Clean, production-ready code
- **Communication**: Clear explanation of approach
- **Edge Cases**: Comprehensive handling of corner cases

## üìû Getting Help

If you're stuck on a problem:

1. Review the corresponding lesson in the main week folder
2. Check the problem constraints and examples again
3. Try to solve a simpler version first
4. Look at the reference solution (last resort)
5. Understand the solution before moving on

Remember: The goal is learning, not just getting the right answer!
