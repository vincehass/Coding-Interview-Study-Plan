def house_robber_practice(nums: List[int]) -> int:

    PROBLEM: House Robber
    
    DESCRIPTION:
    You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has 
    a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each 
    of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically 
    contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
    
    Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the 
    maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
    
    CONSTRAINTS:
    - 1 <= nums.length <= 100
    - 0 <= nums[i] <= 400
    
    EXAMPLES:
    Example 1:
        Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
        Output: 4
        Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) then rob house 3 (money = 3).
        Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
    
    Example 2:
        Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
        Output: 12
        Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
        Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

    PROBLEM: Decode Ways
    
    DESCRIPTION:
    A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:
    'A' -> "1", 'B' -> "2", ..., 'Z' -> "26"
    
    To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters 
    using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, "11106" 
    can be mapped into: "AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6) or "KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6).
    
    Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.
    
    CONSTRAINTS:
