def two_sum_practice(nums, target):

    PROBLEM: Two Sum
    
    DESCRIPTION:
    Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of 
    the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.
    
    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may 
    not use the same element twice.
    
    You can return the answer in any order.
    
    CONSTRAINTS:
    - 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
    - -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
    - -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
    - Only one valid answer exists
    
    EXAMPLES:
    Example 1:
        Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
        Output: [0,1]
        Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
    
    Example 2:
        Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
        Output: [1,2]
    
    Example 3:

        nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
        nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
        nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
        The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
    
    Example 2:
        Input: nums = [0,1,1]
        Output: []
        Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.
