    PROBLEM: Reorganize String
    
    Given a string s, rearrange the characters of s so that any two adjacent characters are not the same.
    
    Return any possible rearrangement of s or return "" if not possible.
    
    CONSTRAINTS:
    - 1 <= s.length <= 500
    - s consists of lowercase English letters
    
    EXAMPLES:
    Example 1:
        Input: s = "aab"
        Output: "aba"
    
    Example 2:
        Input: s = "aaab"
        Output: ""
    
    APPROACH: Max Heap with Greedy Selection
    
    Always place the most frequent available character
