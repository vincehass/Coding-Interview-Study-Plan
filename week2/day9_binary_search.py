                    WEEK 2 - DAY 9: BINARY SEARCH ALGORITHM
                           Meta Interview Preparation
=============================================================================

THEORY SECTION (1 Hour)
======================

1. BINARY SEARCH FUNDAMENTALS
   - Divide and conquer algorithm on sorted data
   - Key insight: Eliminate half of search space in each step
   - Time complexity: O(log n), Space: O(1) iterative, O(log n) recursive
   - Requires sorted or monotonic property

2. BINARY SEARCH TEMPLATE
   - Standard template prevents off-by-one errors
   - Three key components:
     * Initialization: left = 0, right = len(array) - 1
     * Loop condition: while left <= right
     * Update: left = mid + 1 or right = mid - 1

3. BINARY SEARCH VARIATIONS
   - Find exact target
   - Find first/last occurrence
   - Find insertion position
   - Search in rotated arrays
   - Find peak elements
   - Search in 2D matrices

4. SEARCH SPACE THINKING
   - Binary search not just for arrays
   - Any monotonic function can be binary searched
   - Examples: sqrt(x), capacity problems, optimization problems
   - Key: Define search space and monotonic property

5. COMMON PITFALLS
   - Off-by-one errors in boundary conditions
   - Infinite loops from incorrect updates
   - Integer overflow: use mid = left + (right - left) // 2
   - Incorrect termination conditions

6. TRANSITION FROM BST
   - BST search navigates tree structure
   - Binary search navigates array indices
   - Both use comparison-based elimination
   - Both achieve O(log n) with divide-and-conquer
