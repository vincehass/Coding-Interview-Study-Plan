- ✅ Optimize solutions iteratively

### 🎯 Meta Interview Tips

1. **Communication First**: Explain your approach before coding
2. **Start Simple**: Begin with brute force, then optimize
3. **Edge Cases**: Discuss empty inputs, single elements, duplicates
4. **Clean Code**: Use meaningful variable names, proper indentation
5. **Test Examples**: Walk through your solution with given examples
6. **Time/Space**: Always discuss complexity before finishing

### 📅 Timeline Recommendations

**If you have 4+ weeks**: Follow the complete plan as designed
**If you have 2-3 weeks**: Focus on Week 1 + Meta-specific problems (Week 4, Day 21)
**If you have 1 week**: Intensive Week 1 + pattern recognition practice

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone/Download** all files to your local machine
2. **Run the interactive guide**: `python run_study_plan.py`
3. **Start with Day 1**: Begin systematic preparation
4. **Track progress**: Mark completed days and note weak areas
5. **Practice daily**: Consistency is key for interview success
