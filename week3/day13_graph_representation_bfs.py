FOCUS: Graph basics, breadth-first search
TIME ALLOCATION: 4 hours
- Theory (1 hour): Graph representations, BFS algorithm

GRAPH REPRESENTATIONS:

1. ADJACENCY LIST:
   - Space: O(V + E)
   - Good for sparse graphs
   - Easy to iterate over neighbors
   
   Example: {0: [1, 2], 1: [0, 3], 2: [0], 3: [1]}

2. ADJACENCY MATRIX:
   - Space: O(VÂ²)
   - Good for dense graphs
   - O(1) edge lookup
   
   Example: [[0, 1, 1, 0],
             [1, 0, 0, 1],
             [1, 0, 0, 0],
             [0, 1, 0, 0]]

BFS ALGORITHM:
- Time: O(V + E)
- Space: O(V)
- Uses queue (FIFO)
- Explores level by level
- Finds shortest path in unweighted graphs
